# Mission Planner to Litchi
## What is this application for?
Mission Planner to Litchi is a tool to convert 
[Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) (ArduCopter) 
Waypoint files to [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/) CSV Format to execute on Drones (e.g. DJI Drones). 

Mission Planner to Litchi was developed to be used to convert mapping survey missions from 
[Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) to 
[Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/).

### Survey missions in [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/)

Litchi doesn't support Survey mode yet, but here is a workaround!
You will need [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) installed 
in order to plan your mission.
